# Echoes Player - Angular2 Version
Echoes is a great youtube player developed by [Oren Farhi](http://orizens.com).
It's fun & easy to listen or watch videos from youtube with Echoes.
What if youtube was designed to be used as music player?
This repository is an implementation of Echoes Player with angular 2 - It's still a work in progress aimed at learning angular 2.

Echoes Player is also available as a [Chrome Application](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/echoes-player/aaenpaopfebcmdaegggjbkhaedlbbkde)

It can be regarded as the Media Player experience for youtube listening pleasure.

## What's Inside
This is a clone and modification of [AngularClass angular2 webpack starter](http://github.com/angularclass/angular2-webpack-starter).  
It's a quite robust starter which includes inside everything needed to experiment with angular2, prepare for production and testing as well.

### Quick start
**Make sure you have Node version >= 5.0 and NPM >= 3**

```bash
# install the repo with npm
npm install

# start the server
npm start

# use Hot Module Replacement (disabled for now)
# npm run server:dev:hmr
```
go to [http://0.0.0.0:3000](http://0.0.0.0:3000) or [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## File Structure (adopted from angularclass)
I use the component approach in our starter. This is the new standard for developing Angular apps and a great way to ensure maintainable code by encapsulation of our behavior logic. A component is basically a self contained app usually in a single file or a folder with each concern as a file: style, template, specs, e2e, and component class. Here's how it looks:
```
angular2-webpack-starter/

# Development Guide

### build files
```bash
# development
npm run build:dev
# production
npm run build:prod
```

### hot module replacement (disabled)
```bash
npm run server:dev:hmr
```

### watch and build files
```bash
npm run watch
```

### run tests
```bash
npm run test
```

### run end-to-end tests
```bash
# make sure you have your server running in another terminal
npm run e2e
```

### run webdriver (for end-to-end)
```bash
npm run webdriver:update
npm run webdriver:start
```

### run Protractor's elementExplorer (for end-to-end)
```bash
npm run webdriver:start
# in another terminal
npm run e2e:live
```

# Configuration
Configuration files live in `config/` we are currently using webpack, karma, and protractor for different stages of your application

### Visual Studio Code + Debugger for Chrome
> Install [Debugger for Chrome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome) and see docs for instructions to launch Chrome 

The included `.vscode` automatically connects to the webpack development server on port `3000`.

# Types
> When you include a module that doesn't include Type Definitions inside of the module you can include external Type Definitions with @types

i.e, to have youtube api support, run this command in terminal: 
```shell
npm i @types/youtube @types/gapi @types/gapi.youtube
``` 
In some cases where your code editor doesn't support Typescript 2 yet or these types weren't listed in ```tsconfig.json```, add these to **"src/custom-typings.d.ts"** to make peace with the compile check: 
```es6
import '@types/gapi.youtube';
import '@types/gapi';
import '@types/youtube';
```

## Custom Type Definitions
When including 3rd party modules you also need to include the type definition for the module
if they don't provide one within the module. You can try to install it with @types

```
npm install @types/node
npm install @types/lodash
```

If you can't find the type definition in the registry we can make an ambient definition in
this file for now. For example

```typescript
declare module "my-module" {
  export function doesSomething(value: string): string;
}
```


If you're prototyping and you will fix the types later you can also declare it as type any

```typescript
declare var assert: any;
declare var _: any;
declare var $: any;
```

If you're importing a module that uses Node.js modules which are CommonJS you need to import as

```typescript
import * as _ from 'lodash';
```
